# Advanced C Library

**Advanced C Library** is a collection of C libraries designed to provide efficient, reusable, and flexible components for various programming tasks. The library offers a set of tools to simplify development and improve performance, with a focus on modularity and extensibility.

## Features

- A growing set of libraries that can be easily extended.
- Efficient and optimized implementations for various tasks.
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux).
- Performance-enhancing features using compiler-specific attributes.

## Installation

You can clone the repository and include the source files directly in your C project:

```bash

```

## Usage

After including the necessary header files, you can start using the library in your project. For example, to initialize and manipulate a string stream:

```c
#include "string_stream.h"

// Usage example for string stream
str_stream* stream = str_create(16);
str_append(stream, "Hello, World!");
```
